            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The inaugural conference featured a modest lineup of speakers, primarily local experts, and a
                few keynote presentations from industry leaders. The primary focus was on software development,
                internet innovations, and the impact of emerging technologies on businesses. Despite its humble
                beginnings, the conference quickly gained traction, attracting attention from media and industry
                stakeholders.
