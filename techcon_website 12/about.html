            <h2>History<h2>
                    <p>TechCon was founded in 2001 in response to the rapid advancements in technology and the
                        burgeoning interest in the tech sector following the dot-com boom. The first event was organized
                        by a small group of tech entrepreneurs and industry professionals who aimed to create a platform
                        for sharing ideas, showcasing new technologies, and fostering networking opportunities.

                        The inaugural conference featured a modest lineup of speakers, primarily local experts, and a
                        few keynote presentations from industry leaders. The primary focus was on software development,
                        internet innovations, and the impact of emerging technologies on businesses. Despite its humble
                        beginnings, the conference quickly gained traction, attracting attention from media and industry
                        stakeholders.</p>
